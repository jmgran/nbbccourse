### Course overview

This course gives an overview of concepts and methods for estimating causal effects of treatments on censored time-to-event outcomes. There will be an emphasis on practical implementation, and the course will combine lectures and demonstrations in R. At the end of the course, participants should be equipped to perform analyses to address questions about causal effects of treatments on their own data.

Topics discussed include choices of causal estimands, censoring and identification assumptions, and methods for confounding adjustment. Both point treatments and time-dependent treatment strategies will be covered, and methods such as standardisation/g-computation, inverse probability of treatment weighting and cloning-censoring-and-weighting approaches. Links will be made to the target trial framework.
